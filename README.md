🥁 Introducing Deepist, the distraction-free workspace 

![screenshot](Deepist-GUI.png)

Demo: https://opensourcetreasure.github.io/Deepist/index.html

🎷 Let's take a look at the interface

✅ The name Deepist doesn't appear

✅ There is no title or favicon

✅ No logos or icons

✅ No top navigation bar and no footer

✅ No scrolling

✅ No cookies

✅ No admin area

✅ No notifications

✅ No chat


😏 These are features, not bugs. 

There are sections for you to write about your goals, ideas, coding, content and even a Relax button to chill out when you want.

💡 PS - When you have many browser tabs open, Deepist is the one without the title and favicon!
